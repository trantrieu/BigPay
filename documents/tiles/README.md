# Tiles sample server

This is an example server side for the tiles problem, APP001.

Run it by installing [go](https://golang.org/) and executing the following command:

```
go run svr.go
```

it listens on port 9235.

You are welcome to examine the source code, but your solution will be assessed on peformance with a server that complies with the specification in question  - and may not run this code.
